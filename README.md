# Photon Demo Utilities

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Photon Demo Utilities is a simple implementation of a Photon application structure - thread-based and invokable via a command-line utility. This demo supplements the "Sustainable Systems, Powered By Python" talk presented by Michael Laing and Sharon Tartarone at All Things Open 2019 and illustrates key concepts.

Refer to the umbrella repository - [photon-dev_demo](https://github.com/nytimes/photon-dev_demo) - for instructions on how to get started.
